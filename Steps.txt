classes:
1. map
2. characters
3. interactable / non interactable objects

objects:
for interactable / non interactable objects:
1. walls
2. stairs (to go between levels)
3. other props we need (all of this depends on the level design which
we honestly wont pay too much attention to). unique props we'll keep to a bare 
minimum while the number of each of these props will be as much as can make to fill
up space

characters:
1. player
2. shafay shamail (final)
3. adam zaman (second last)
4. EE (second)
5. amer rasheed (first)

maps:
almost all of our levels will be simple and roughly the same (i dont think we'll
have time for the side levels or whatever but of course we could do them later
if we intend to just make this game larger after the project has ended)

mechanics:
1. walking around
2. conversation
3. undertale style battle
